## Stopwatch App

- Vanilla js used.
- The js does not remove and unmount any of the DOM elements, it just applies display:none to DOM elements that are not required to be shown.
- The code is highly optimized and stores the DOM elements and saves calls to document.getElementById.
- Pure css , vanilla js and HTML used.
- Stopwatch is nicely centered in the screen.
- The time is stored as a variable in seconds and display is calculated once we want to render new time.
- Common time rendering code is made into a function to save code repetition.
